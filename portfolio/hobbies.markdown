I’m passionate about learning new skills, and improving upon those I already have. Currently, I am learning aspnet core, dotnet core, python and machine learning in my free time. I attended the M-Cubed data-science conference in 2018 to further my exposure to ML.

I’m also interested in DevOps/CI/CD, and so I’ve spent some time looking into Docker / Kubernetes (minikube) / Jenkins / Ansible. Whilst this isn’t my area of expertise I am interested in learning more, and plan on spending more time in this domain.

I try to keep up-to-date by viewing the Thoughtworks’ Tech-Radar, and generally following Martin Fowler and reading his books; such as Continuous Delivery, and Accelerate. I’m also making my way through the new C# in Depth 4th Edition by the legendary Jon Skeet, and have CLR via C# on my backlog. I also use tech blog aggregators, such as The Morning Brew, by Chris Alcock.

I enjoy playing foosball, board games, and rocket league, I also enjoy climbing, running, yoga, and spending time with my family.
